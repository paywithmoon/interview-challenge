# Bank Balance Microservice - Technical Challenge

## 🎯 Your Mission

You'll be building a **bank balance microservice** that handles:

- **Account creation and balance inquiries**
- **Credit and debit operations**
- **Concurrency handling and data integrity**

You'll demonstrate your skills with **Node.js + TypeScript + Express** and **Knex.js + MySQL**.

**Estimated duration:** 35-45 minutes

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- MySQL server running locally
- Basic knowledge of TypeScript and Express

### Setup Instructions

1. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Create MySQL database:**

   ```sql
   CREATE DATABASE bank_interview;
   ```

3. **Update database configuration:**
   Edit `knexfile.js` with your MySQL credentials

4. **Run migrations:**

   ```bash
   npm run migrate
   ```

5. **Start development server:**

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

The server will start on `http://localhost:3000`

---

## 📋 What You'll Build

### Step 1: Get Started (5-8 min)

✅ Project structure is ready
✅ Dependencies are configured

- **Your task:** Verify the setup works and test the health endpoint: `GET /health`

### Step 2: Basic Account Operations (8-10 min)

**Build these endpoints:**

- `POST /accounts` → create a new account with zero balance
- `GET /accounts/:id` → retrieve account details and current balance

### Step 3: Money Operations (10-12 min)

**Add these endpoints:**

- `POST /accounts/:id/credit` → add money to account
- `POST /accounts/:id/debit` → remove money from account

**Important rules:**

- Never allow negative balances

### Step 4: Expose the Problem (8-10 min)

**Create a race condition demonstration:**

- Build an endpoint `/simulate-race` that shows what happens with concurrent operations
- Use multiple simultaneous debit requests on the same account
- Demonstrate the data inconsistency issue

### Step 5: Fix the Problem (8-10 min)

**Implement proper concurrency control:**

- Fix the issue on the `/simulate-race`endpoint
- Use database strategy to prevent concurrency issues

## 🧪 Testing Your Work

Test your endpoints manually or run the provided test suite:

```bash
npm test
```

You can also test your API endpoints using:

- **cURL commands**
- **Postman/Insomnia**  
- **Your browser** (for GET requests)

Example test: `curl http://localhost:3000/health`

## 📊 Database Schema

```sql
CREATE TABLE accounts (
  id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
  balance DECIMAL(10, 2) NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

---

## 🔧 Available Scripts

- `npm run dev` - Start development server with hot reload
- `npm run build` - Build TypeScript to JavaScript
- `npm start` - Run production build
- `npm run migrate` - Run database migrations
- `npm run rollback` - Rollback last migration
- `npm test` - Run tests

---

## ✅ What We're Looking For

| Key Areas | What This Means |
|-----------|-----------------|
| **Database Transactions** | Proper use of Knex transactions to ensure data consistency |
| **Concurrency Handling** | Understanding and solving race condition problems |
| **Code Organization** | Clean, readable, and well-structured code |
| **Problem-Solving** | Clear thinking and explanation of your approach |

---

## 💡 Code Examples & Hints

### Using Knex Transactions

```typescript
await db.transaction(async trx => {
  // All your database operations here
  // If anything fails, the entire transaction rolls back
});
```

---

## 🎯 You'll Know You're Successful When

- [ ] All your endpoints respond correctly and handle errors gracefully
- [ ] You can demonstrate the race condition problem with your simulation
- [ ] Your transaction implementation prevents data inconsistencies
- [ ] Your code is organized and easy to follow
- [ ] You can explain your design decisions and trade-offs

---

## 💬 Questions & Discussion

Feel free to:

- **Ask questions** about requirements or clarify expectations
- **Explain your thought process** as you work through the problems
- **Discuss alternative approaches** and their trade-offs
- **Share any challenges** you encounter along the way
